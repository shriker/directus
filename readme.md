## Description
Directus is a free and open-source database API and 'headless' CMS. Unlike traditional CMS that encompass your entire project codebase, the decoupled approach of Directus offers an API and SDKs to connect your content to: websites, native apps, kiosks, IoT devices, or any other data-driven projects.

Directus makes no assumptions about how you should architect your database â€“ giving you complete freedom to optimize structure and performance for projects of any size or complexity. Built on top of the API is our feature-rich admin webapp (CMS) which dynamically maps to your database's schema, instantly providing your users/clients with an intuitive interface for managing content.

Learn more at [getdirectus.com](https://getdirectus.com), chat with us on [Slack](https://slack.getdirectus.com), and follow us on Twitter: [@directus](https://twitter.com/directus)


## Installation
Download the latest pre-built version from [our releases page](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases) or clone this repo and install the composer dependencies by running `composer install` from the root folder. 

### Requirements:
NGINX or Apache Server, MySQL 5.2+, PHP 5.6+ (curl, gd, finfo, pdo_mysql)

### Database types
While Directus has been abstracted to allow for different database adapters in the future, currently only MySQL is supported. PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB support are under development â€“ and we hope to expand support for additional database types as we gain contributors.
